		<h3>Welcome</h3>
		<p>I'm not sure what I'm eventually going to post here, but for now it's going to be an adventure in learning to code! 
		Bear with me as this site becomes more fully fledged throughout the semester, and maybe eventually there will be some actual content for you to enjoy!</p>
		
		<h5>19 September 2019</h5>
		<h3>Portfolio Page is accessible now!</h3>
		<p> I'm excited to say that this website just got a little less boring! Starting now, you can click <a href="ClaireBoudour.github.io/portfolio.html" target="_self">here</a>!</p>
