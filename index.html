     	<h3>Adding in Frameworks!</h3>	
     	<p>Now that the midterm is over, this website is getting a little more fleshed out! This week, we used framework to elevate the style of our pages. Using Materialize, I re-designed the home page to have two columns with buttons on the lefthand side linking to other pages. Also, I finally loaded my CSS externally instead of leaving it all in the head, which allows me a lot more freedom and creativity.</p> 	
      	<h5>3 October 2019</h5>
		<h3>Starting to learn CSS!</h3>
		<p>As my adventure in learning to code continues we've come to an exhilarating next step, CSS! 
		Finally, this website has just a little bit of style. So far, the only style elements I've learned are text color and text alignment,
		but I think they make everything look a <b>lot</b> more fun! Let me know what you think of my color choices!</p>
		
		<h5>19 September 2019</h5>
		<h3>Portfolio Page is accessible now!</h3>
		<p>I'm excited to say that this website just got a little less boring! Starting now, you can click <a href="ClaireBoudour.github.io/portfolio.html" target="_self">here</a>!</p>
		<h5>12 September 2019</h5>
		<h3>Welcome</h3>
		<p>I'm not sure what I'm eventually going to post here, but for now it's going to be an adventure in learning to code! 
		Bear with me as this site becomes more fully fledged throughout the semester, and maybe eventually there will be some actual content for you to enjoy!</p>
